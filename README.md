## Description

Simple banking app to track transfer between different accounts. Makes use of data storing multiple account details and transfers as well as multiple functions to calculate and display balances, inflows, outflows, sort data and manipulate arrays (filter, reduce, map, etc.). The CSS and HTML portion of this was imported from a lecture, and only the JavaScript was edited by me.

## Usage Information

This could be used to store transactional information for a group of people and make simple transfers between the accounts.<br>
Using the accounts that have already been set up, use the following information to login: <br>
username : js, password: 1111 <br>
username: jd, password: 2222 <br>
To make transfers between the accounts, input "js" or "jd" in the Transfer to field and then the amount. <br>
The loan will be approved in a few seconds after clicking the request button, assuming it falls within the 'acceptable' amount. <br>
To close the account, simply put the username and password information in again.
